## Installation

### Node.js/NPM
When installing Node, NPM automatically comes with Node. To install the latest version of Node, we recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once homebrew is installed, install Node in the terminal doing `$ brew install node`. Verify that both Node.js and NPM were installed successfully bying do `$ node -v` and `$ npm -v`.

### Loopback
You will need Loopback installed in order to use the command line interface. Installing is simple by doing `$ $ npm install -g loopback-cli`.

### Setup
Now that we have the requirements installed, we can begin setting up our local environment. 

1. In a terminal, do `$ git@github.com:silverlogic/custom-facebook-auth.git`.
1. Go to the root of the project by doing `$ cd custom-facebook-auth`.
1. Now we need to build the dependencies by doing `$ npm install`.
1. Now the project can be opened in any source editor for modifying.
